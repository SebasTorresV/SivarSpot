// This file is now obsolete. The application has been refactored to fetch data
// from a backend API (e.g., /api/events, /api/auth/login) instead of using
// these static mock objects. A backend service connected to a database (like PostgreSQL)
// should be implemented to serve data to these API endpoints.
